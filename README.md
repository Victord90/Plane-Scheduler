# Plane-Scheduler



## Overview

Here we have a schedule for private jets! You will have the opportunity to give your own jet a company name and
choose the destination. The only additional information you will need to give the the frequency/rate per
minute the plane will be taking off, as well as the first time it will leave in military time (HH:mm). Once you put the
information in and submit it, you will get back information of when the plane is arriving as well as how long
the plane is away in minutes all in real time.
